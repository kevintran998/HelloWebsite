***** HOW IT WORKS *****

The website is a 'Tech Store' that displays six different poducts. The website includes three pages: index, contact us, and product details. The site utilizes a nav bar, search bar (non-functional), and aside with product filters (non-functional). When the user clicks on a product, they will be sent to a product detail page. The contact us page includes user input, drop-down list, checkbox, and Google Maps features. The site is also responsive when viewed on different-sized screens.
